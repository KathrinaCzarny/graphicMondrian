# graphicMondrian
##### Creates Mondrian's famous art using Java GUI 

*Process*
Created by creating a series of colored boxes layered on top of each other and then added white text on top.
The cyan lines (LineSquare) in the top corner are a subtle addition meant to practice including lines in a graphics program.
